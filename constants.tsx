export const FAQS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Is this free?",
    answer: "The webinar is completely free. Initial consultation is also free. If you want to proceed with detailed mentorship, we'll discuss options then — no pressure ever."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an income guarantee?",
    answer: "No. No legitimate business can guarantee income. Results depend entirely on your effort, learning, and consistency. I can only provide the right guidance and proven systems."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm already in network marketing. Can I still join?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many people are already in network marketing but lack clarity or proper systems. Guidance is for everyone — whether new or experienced."
  },
  {
    question: "How much time do I need to commit?",
    answer: "It depends on your goals. Initially, 1-2 hours daily for learning is enough. As you grow, you decide your own pace."
  },
  {
    question: "Which company is this for?",
    answer: "I'm associated with Forever Living Products. However, my focus isn't on 'selling' the company — it's on helping you understand the business model properly so you can make an informed decision."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like it?",
    answer: "No problem at all. Attend the webinar, get clarity. If you feel this isn't for you, there's zero pressure. The decision is always yours."
